The first task in my internship was to design and implement a file handling utility using core Java. The purpose of this program was to perform basic file operations such as writing to a file, reading from a file, and modifying existing file content. The application uses standard Java classes like File, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and Scanner to manage these operations. I developed this project entirely in the Eclipse IDE using the JavaSE-22 JDK. This task introduced me to low-level I/O operations, exception handling, and resource management. The structure of the program simulates real-world systems where applications must persist and retrieve data, such as log file managers, note-taking tools, or configuration file readers. This task helped reinforce the importance of file manipulation and user input handling in desktop-based applications. Although simple in appearance, file handling is a crucial skill in backend development, especially for managing logs, temporary files, or system data when a database is not integrated. Itâ€™s applicable in both standalone utility software and larger systems needing lightweight data persistence.
